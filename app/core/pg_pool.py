"""
Shared psycopg2 connection pooling for synchronous code paths.

Celery workers and sync helper flows use this pool to avoid opening a new
TCP/SSL connection for every task or request.

Fixes applied:
  C3 — Neon cold-start: TCP keepalive params added to DSN so the OS
       maintains the connection and psycopg2 detects dead sessions quickly.
  C4 — Aborted transaction leak: pooled_connection() now rolls back before
       returning the connection to the pool so the next caller always gets
       a clean connection (not one stuck in InFailedSqlTransaction).

        BEFORE leaving this context manager (current pattern in handle_webhook
